# Air-Quality-Index-AQI-Data-Analysis
In this project, I analyzed air quality index (AQI) data, using pandas to load, explore, and manipulate the dataset. By applying techniques such as Boolean masking, grouping, and concatenation, I provided insights into air pollution levels and related health concerns, offering a deeper understanding of environmental conditions.
